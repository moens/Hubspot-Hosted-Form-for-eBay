# Hubspot Hosted Form for eBay
For eBay lisitng templates, homepage, etc, one needs a js-free form to collect addresses.

I needed to embed a Hubspot email form in an eBay listing template... but Hubspot only has js forms. So, I whipped up this little script to bridge the gap.

 - You have to host this on your webserver...
 - This is only set up for eBay, but could work for other things as well, like a simple Facebook app
 - There are some (noted) logical dead ends... I'll update when I get around to fixing them
 - When you implement, make sure to update hard-coded things like {Your Business Name} and {Your Phone #}
